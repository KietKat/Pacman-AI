# Pacman- AI (Fall 2023)
======================================

## Intro
[The Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/).

> In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Try to build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

Start a game by the command:
```
$ python pacman.py
```
You can see the list of all options and their default values via:
```
$ python pacman.py -h
```

## PHASE 1: Search
- DFS, BFS, UCS, ASTAR, ASTAR heuristic 
```
States are wrapped in a `SearchNode` that stores: 

- the cost to reach the node,
- the previous node, 
- the action that led to the node. 

All the search algorithms variants were implemented using a single 
generic search function and various `Fringe` implementations, one for each
search variant: 
- For DFS, it is stack 
$ python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs
- For BSF, it is queue 
$ python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5
- For UCS, it is a priority queue 
$ python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs
- For A*, it is a priority queue whose keys are computed summing 
the backward cost (as in UCS) to the estimated forward cost computed
by the provided heuristic.
$ python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
```
- Corner problem, Corner heuristic
```
In corner mazes, there are four dots, one in each corner. Our new search problem 
is to find the shortest path through the maze that touches all four corners (whether 
the maze actually has food there or not).

$ python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem
$ python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p AStarCornersAgent -z 0.5
```
- Eating all the dots
```
For this, weâ€™ll need a new search problem definition which formalizes the food-clearing 
problem: FoodSearchProblem in searchAgents.py (implemented for you). A solution is 
defined to be a path that collects all of the food in the Pacman world. For the present 
project, solutions do not take into account any ghosts or power pellets; solutions only 
depend on the placement of walls, regular food and Pacman.

$ python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent
```
